MJOIN(1)		    General Commands Manual		      MJOIN(1)

NAME
     mjoin - Performs a relational join operation on two or more files

SYNOPSIS
     mjoin [-d delimiter] [-f field] [-j join-type] [-s | -S] file file [...]
     mjoin -v

DESCRIPTION
     The mjoin provides a convenient wrapper around the standard join(1)
     utility, allowing joining of two or more files with optional sorting of
     the input data.

     The options are as follows:

     -d delimiter
	     Use the specified single character delimiter as the field
	     delimiter.	 The default delimiter is a comma.

     -f field
	     Join all files on the specified field number.  The default join
	     field is the first field in each file.

     -j join-type
	     Perform a relational join of the specified type.  The join-type
	     option argument must be one of inner, left, right, or full.  The
	     default is to perform a full outer join.

     -s	     Sort the input data on the join field.  The default is to assume
	     that the data is already lexicographically sorted on the
	     appropriate field.

     -S	     Auto-detect whether sorting is needed.  This will invoke sort(1)
	     with its -C option on each input file to detect unsorted data.
	     The data will then be sorted appropriately if needed.  This means
	     possible calling sort(1) twice for each input file.

ENVIRONMENT
     mjoin uses the following environment variables:

     TMPDIR  Directory in which to create temporary files.  This variable is
	     used by mktemp which will revert to use /tmp if the variable is
	     not set.

EXAMPLES
     To be written.
