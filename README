# Shell scripts
------------------------------------------------------------------------

* shell:

    Creates a shell for testing things in.

    This script is useful for testing things in an interactive
    environment other than your usual shell, or for testing things in a
    clean environment with automatic cleanup of any files left behind.

    Creates a "temporary interactive shell" with a temporary working
    directory (unless the "-d" flag is used to specify an existing
    directory) and clean environment.  The working directory is removed
    when the shell exits (unless the "-k" or "-d" flag was used).

    The temporary working directory may also be pre-populated with the
    contents of an existing directory (using the "-s" flag).

    See "man 1 shell" after installation.


* mjoin:

    A convenient script for carrying out relational joins on two or more
    files.

    This script generalises the standard UNIX join utility, making it
    possible to do relational joins (inner, left, right, and full outer
    joins) on two or more possibly unsorted files.

    The data is assumed to be delimited on commas (use "-d" to specify
    an alternative delimiter) and will joined on the first field (or on
    the field specified with "-f").  The input is furthermore assumed to
    be sorted on the join field, but sorting can be requested with "-s"
    (or "-S" for auto-detection of unsorted data).

    See "man 1 mjoin" after installation.
